## Hey there 👋 I am Yasha K. and I am...

⚙️ Founding father of open source libraries for test automation, among which: [Selene][selene] in Python, [NSelene][nselene] in C#, [SelenideJs][selenidejs] in JavaScript/TypeScript, a [bunch of Playwright-ish utils and patterns][playwright-template].

📿 An adept of KISS and Context-Driven approaches. Practitioner and coach in polyglot test automation. I invest in and win from educating teams more than recruiting experienced and expensive engineers. As a leader I practice facilitation over management, empowering teams to become self-organized utilizing Agile and transformative mediation approaches.

⛩️ I believe in sociocracy, flat structures in organizations.

🖋️ I wrote the [«Intro to Software Development (Part I: Frontend)»][intro-to-sd-en] ([in uk][intro-to-sd-uk], [in ru][intro-to-sd-ru]) aimed at beginners from kids to their parents. Occasionally, I post in Ukrainian to [autotestyak.t.me](https://autotestyak.t.me) and [youtube.com/@autotestyak](https://www.youtube.com/@autotestyak). I [retrained][retrained-into-it] immigrants from the east of Ukraine into IT in 2020/2021.

🎼 I learn and practice: biology for psychology, philosophy, storytelling, video production for social networks, [Computer Vision][learncv], guitar and percussion, Capoeira Angola, education in general. I like tea culture and listening to vinyl records.
